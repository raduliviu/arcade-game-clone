Frogger Arcade Game Clone
===============================

This is my submission for the Udacity Arcade Game Clone project.

### How to play
The game can be played either by cloning the project locally and opening index.html or online [here](https://raduliviu.github.io/arcade-game-clone/).

### Rules
To win the game, you have to reach the water on the other side of the board. Your score goes up every time you manage this. If you get hit by an enemy, your score resets and you get put into your starting position.
